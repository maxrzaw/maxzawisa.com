						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide MRun Sprinters with a community running log</li>
							<li>Encourage Sprinters to keep working out</li>
							<li>Distribute the training plan</li>
							<li>Keep feature set minimal</li>
							<li>Proof of concept with React Native and Django</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>I built this app during the summer of 2020.
						It is designed as a tool to help the MRun Sprinters keep track of their workouts and provide
						some motivation for us to keep running even when we cannot run together anymore.
						The promary focus was to build a platform for sharing our workouts with each other without all
						the unnecessary features found in running apps like strava since most of us don't have running
						watches.
						Most of us that record our runs use plain text and don't share, but this will allow us to
						motivate each other to run more.
						I built the back end server using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer">Django</a> and the front end was built using <a
							href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native</a>.
